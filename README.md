# bpartymarce244: Ice Cream Party and Weather Simulation Package

[View the website here!](https://ptds2024.github.io/bpartymarce244/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

`bpartymarce244` is an R package designed to help you: 1. Simulate ice cream parties by calculating the volume and surface area of cones. 2. Visualize weather forecasts and simulate party needs based on weather conditions. 3. Use an interactive Shiny app to explore weather data and plan resources for multiple locations.

This package was developed as part of a programming tools assignment, combining R programming, Shiny apps, and weather forecasting.

## Key Features

1.  **Cone Calculations**:
    -   Define the cone's radius based on height.
    -   Calculate the volume and surface area of cones.
    -   Simulate variations in cone shapes to account for realistic scenarios.
2.  **Weather-Based Simulations**:
    -   Retrieve 5-day weather forecasts for cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    -   Use weather data (temperature, humidity, and pressure) to simulate guest behavior and estimate resource needs.
3.  **Shiny App Integration**:
    -   Visualize weather trends across multiple cities.
    -   Simulate ice cream party needs (cone volume and surface area) for up to 3 cities.
